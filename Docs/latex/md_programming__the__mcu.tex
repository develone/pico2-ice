To upload a new firmware image on the RP2350 (the "{}pico"{} part of "{}pico2-\/ice"{}), you need to switch to that RP2350 UF2 bootloader mode instead of the FPGA UF2 mode.

You can do that by connecting a jumper between the {\ttfamily BT} pin a {\ttfamily Gnd} pin or hold the SW1 button, then toggle power\+:


\begin{DoxyEnumerate}
\item Connect the {\ttfamily BT} pin to ground or hold the SW1 button. For instance with a pair of tweezers, a jumper, or an uncoated paper clip.
\item Toggle power to the RP2350, for example by unplugging and re-\/plugging the USB cable.
\item Disconnect the {\ttfamily BT} pin from ground.
\item Look for an USB drive named {\ttfamily RP2350} and mount it, open it, and check that there are only 2 files in it\+: {\ttfamily INFO.\+HTML} and {\ttfamily INFO\+\_\+\+UF2.\+TXT}.
\item Copy the {\ttfamily .uf2} firmware file onto the USB drive.
\item Eject the USB drive. At this step, the firmware should be uploaded and running.

Since version \href{https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice/releases}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily v1.\+6.\+1}}}, it is possible to reboot the pico2-\/ice into bootloader "{}\+BOOTSEL"{} mode without jumpers\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}picocom --baud 1200 /dev/ttyACM0
\end{DoxyVerb}


This uses the \href{https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/dev/platform-specification/\#1200-bps-bootloader-reset}{\texttt{ convention established by Arduino boards}} which reset into bootloader mode when connecting with baud 1200.

After this, it becomes possible to use the \href{https://github.com/raspberrypi/picotool}{\texttt{ picotool}} to control the firmware (upload, check version, reboot)\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}$ sudo picotool info
Program Information
 name:      pico_ice_default
 features:  USB stdin / stdout
\end{DoxyVerb}

This means the device remained in "{}bootloader"{} mode. One thing to check is that the {\ttfamily BT} pin is not connected to anything anymore, then try to reset the board.
