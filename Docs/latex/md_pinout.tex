To program the FPGA, one needs to tell the synthesis tools which pins to connect to the signals in your RTL. There are two different ways to name the pins. The wafer names are words like {\ttfamily IOB\+\_\+6a} and {\ttfamily IOT\+\_\+8b}, and the pin numbers have names like {\ttfamily ICE\+\_\+2}, {\ttfamily ICE\+\_\+3}, and {\ttfamily ICE\+\_\+4}. Both sets of names can be found in this \href{https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/blob/main/rtl/pico_ice.pcf}{\texttt{ PCF file}}.

For Amaranth, until this gets upstreamed, the various board resources including its pins are defined on \href{https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/blob/main/amaranth/pico_ice.py}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily pico\+\_\+ice.\+py}}}.\hypertarget{md_pinout_autotoc_md31}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{With code on the RP2350}{With code on the RP2350}}\label{md_pinout_autotoc_md31}
The FPGA pins and other signals are defined in \href{https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/blob/pico2-ice_develop/include/boards/pico2_ice.h}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily pico\+\_\+ice.\+h}}}.

The PMOD pins can also be accessed from \href{https://github.com/tinyvision-ai-inc/pico-ice-sdk/blob/pico2-ice_develop/include/ice_pmod.h}{\texttt{ {\ttfamily ice\+\_\+pmod.\+h}}}.\hypertarget{md_pinout_autotoc_md32}{}\doxysection{\texorpdfstring{SPI Pinouts}{SPI Pinouts}}\label{md_pinout_autotoc_md32}
For debugging the FPGA \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} SPI \texorpdfstring{$<$}{<}-\/\texorpdfstring{$>$}{>} Flash/\+RAM interface it is very helpful to use the 4 through holes on the upper right of the FPGA, and to connect a logic analyzer to the upper right PMOD. Remember that the default boot process leaves the Flash switched {\ttfamily off}. With the Yosys icepack command, the {\ttfamily -\/s} option boots the Flash in the {\ttfamily on} state.
