05/20/25 I can not get pico2-ice/FIRMWARE/pico2-ice-default to compile.
The pico-ice/FIRMWARE/pico-ice-default builds for eith the pico or pico2.
In the file pico-ice/FRIRMWARE/pico-ice-defaault/main,c  you see that ICE_27 & ICE_25 are used
for the 2nd uart 
            printf("  UART TX on RP0 = ICE27\r\n");
            printf("  UART RX on RP1 = ICE25\r\n");
            printf("\r\n");
I can not locate where theses pins are being setup.
I want ot to use ICE26 and ICE23 instead.
